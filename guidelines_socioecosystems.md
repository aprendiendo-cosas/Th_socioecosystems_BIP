## Objectives of the Teaching Session

+ To understand the concept of socioecosystem as an entity that allows us to relate human societies with Nature.
+ To advance in the understanding of socioecosystems as adaptive complex systems.
+ To adopt the conceptual framework of socioecosystems as a key element for the development of the subject.
+ To understand the concept of ecosystem service.
+ To achieve an initial understanding of the concept of adaptation in socioecosystems through the conceptual framework of panarchy.



## Argumentative Thread

+ We begin with a simple definition of a socioecosystem.
+ The existence of a concept that combines Nature and Society has important implications for our subject: we can no longer understand nature without society and vice versa.
+ This also implies that we need multidisciplinary and holistic approaches (such as those provided by environmental scientists) to improve the management of socioecosystems.
+ Next, we describe how socioecosystems exhibit a structural hierarchy in the domain of space (from ecoelements to ecozones), time (delayed effects or hysteresis), and governance (spatial scales in the institutions that manage the territory). The conceptual framework analyzed in class will be used during the description of types of ecosystems in block 4 of the subject.
+ When describing the previous conceptual framework, the concept of "ecosystem service" arises. We describe the three types of services most frequently used.
+ Finally, we briefly discuss the most common adaptation mechanism in socioecosystems: the panarchic cycle that alternates states of growth, conservation, release, and reorganization.

During the class, we used [this](https://github.com/aprendiendo-cosas/Th_socioecosystems_BIP/blob/2024_2025/presentation/socioecosystems.pptx?raw=true) presentation as a guideline.
